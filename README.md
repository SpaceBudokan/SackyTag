# SackyTag
Sackytag BASH script filesystem based image tagging suite.
When you tag an image (or any file) with  the SackyTag tagsack, a folder with that tag's name is created (if it does not already exist.) A symbolic link to the original file is made in the folder. When you search for images with prticular tags, the folders with those names are searched, and symbolic links to those files are placed in the folder 'searchres.'
